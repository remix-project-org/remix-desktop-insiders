# Remix Desktop Insiders

**Remix Desktop** is an Electron version of Remix IDE.  It works on Linux, Windows, & Macs.

Like the name says, it is a desktop app - so it can seamlessly access files on your computer's filesystem.  

This Insiders version of Remix Desktop is designed to bring you the latest features and innovations before they hit the mainstream. As an Insider, you get exclusive access to experimental updates.

As this is an exeperimental release, be careful and always back up your files.

The app will automatically update itself when there is a new release.

## About Remix Desktop

### Differences between Remix Desktop & Remix IDE - the web app

- You always use the local file system, no need to upload files. Just use your regular local workflow.
- You can use native terminals ( bash, sh, zsh, powershell, cmd.exe ) and use for example git there like you normally would.
- You can have multiple instances of Remix running at the same time
- You can run it partially offline. Some plugins will not work when offline.
- You can work on your files in other editors, tools at the same time.
