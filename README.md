## About Remix Desktop

### Differences between Remix Desktop & Remix IDE - the web app

- You always use the local file system, no need to upload files. Just use your regular local workflow.
- You can use native terminals ( bash, sh, zsh, powershell, cmd.exe ) and use for example git there like you normally would.
- You can have multiple instances of Remix running at the same time
- You can run it partially offline. Some plugins will not work when offline.
- You can work on your files in other editors, tools at the same time.
